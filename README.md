<h2 align="center">Resume</h2>

This is the repo for my digital resume. It's built with Gatsbyjs, (using styled-system, styled-components, framer-motion to name a few interesting packages). It's a static site, hosted on Netlify.

## Tech

This little "micro-site" is built based on (Gatsby)[https://gatsbyjs.org/]. I chose Gatsby as it allows a static site to be developed _very_ rapidly, with a great many tools "out-of-the-box".

Gatsby is a static-site-generation framework built on React.

I used [styled-system](https://styled-system.com/) along with [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) for styling and theming.

I wanted to experiment with [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) for animations, so that's what's going on there.

## Notes

This was really just an excuse to play around with a few things, do a bit of learning. It's a mess.

Also I did try and build this in a couple of hours. Some uhhh.. best practices may have been skipped.

Also there are zero tests.

## TODO

- Some perf improvements
- Find an excuse to add some SVG path animations
- Add more themes?
- Add reduced motion toggle
